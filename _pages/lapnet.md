We are currently working on an exciting project in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We aim to combine 1) a multicentre data collection on the current management of benign gallbladder disease and 2) the creation of a predictive algorithm to assist in identifying the critical view of safety during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

We are currently doing a preliminary work on the algorithm. Contributors will share pubmed co-authorship. To participate sign up below:
