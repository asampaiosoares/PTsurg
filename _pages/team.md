We are a team of general surgery trainees dedicated to collaborative research in surgery.

### Aim

Our aim is to provide opportunities to develop multicentric research studies in Portugal. This wouldn't have been possible without our partners who have been a fundamental support to our group. And, obviously, without the engagement of so many highly dedicated colleagues across all the country.

Stay tuned for more updates on our new projects!

### Partners
- West Midlands Research Collaborative
- Eurosurg
- ItSurg
- Portuguese Clinical Research Infrastructure Network
- Portuguese College of Surgeons
- Laboratório de Farmacologia Clínica e Terapêutica, Lisbon Medical School
